Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Versionista understands and
appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor,
and at times a business associate, Versionista is not directly responsible for
health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this,
Versionista has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier
for Versionista Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

- [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)

## Data Retention Policy

- Current Versionista Customers have data stored by Versionista as a part of the
  Versionista Service.
- Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps
  are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the
     option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds
     they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how
     to download their data from Versionista and/or to have Versionista continue
     to store the data at a rate of \$25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more
     than 100GB of data, Versionista will work with Customer to determine
     storage costs.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Versionista
     within 30 days, Versionista removes data from Versionista systems and
     Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
