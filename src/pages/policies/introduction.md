# 1. Introduction

Fox and Geese LLC D/B/A Versionista ("Versionista") is committed to ensuring the
confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all digital information
it receives, maintains, processes and/or transmits on behalf of its Customers.
As providers of compliant, hosted infrastructure used by technology vendors,
developers, designers, agencies, custom development shops, and enterprises,
Versionista strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information
security, mitigate risk for its Customers, and assure known breaches are
completely and effectively communicated in a timely manner. The following
documents address core policies used by Versionista to maintain compliance and
assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and
transmit data for Versionista Customers.

Versionista provides secure and compliant cloud-based software. This hosted
software falls into two broad categories: 1) **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
and 2) **Platform Add-ons**. These Categories are cited throughout policies as
Customers in each category inherit different policies, procedures, and
obligations from Versionista.

## 1.1 Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS Customers utilize hosted software and infrastructure from Versionista to
deploy, host, and scale custom developed applications and configured databases.
These customers are deployed into compliant containers run on systems secured
and managed by Versionista. Versionista does not have insight or access into
application level data of PaaS Customers and, as such, does not have the ability
to secure or manage risk associated with application level vulnerabilities and
security weaknesses. Versionista makes every effort to reduce the risk of
unauthorized disclosure, access, and/or breach of PaaS Customer data through
network (firewalls, dedicated IP spaces, etc) and server settings (encryption at
rest and in transit, OSSEC throughout the Platform, etc).

## 1.2 Compliance Inheritance

Versionista provides hosted software infrastructure for its Customers.
Versionista's service offerings are available on AWS, Azure, Rackspace, and
SoftLayer.

Versionista signs business associate agreements (BAAs) with its Customers. These
BAAs outline Versionista obligations and Customer obligations, as well as
liability in the case of a breach.

Versionista does not act as a covered entity. When Versionista does operate as a
business associate (not a subcontractor), Versionista does not interface with
users to obtain or provide access to ePHI. Access to ePHI is through our
customers' applications.

Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this, Versionista
Customers, in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, must
implement certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of
compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of Versionista.

Mappings of HIPAA Rules to Versionista controls and a mapping of what Rules are
inherited by Customers, both Platform Customers and Add-on Customers, are
covered in [ยง2](#2-hipaa-inheritance).

## 1.3 Versionista Organizational Concepts

The physical infrastructure environment is hosted at
[Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/),
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS), and
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/). The network components and
supporting network infrastructure are contained within the Rackspace, AWS,
Azure, and infrastructures and managed by Rackspace, AWS, Microsoft, and IBM
(respectively). Versionista does not have physical access into the network
components. The Versionista environment consists of Cisco firewalls; nginx web
servers; Java, Python, and Go application servers; Percona and PostgreSQL
database servers; Logstash logging servers; Linux Ubuntu monitoring servers;
Windows Server virtual machines; Chef and Salt configuration management servers;
OSSEC IDS services; Docker containers; and developer tool servers running on
Linux Ubuntu.

Within the Versionista Platform on Rackspace, AWS, and Azure, all data
transmission is encrypted and all hard drives are encrypted so data at rest is
also encrypted; this applies to all servers - those hosting Docker containers,
databases, APIs, log servers, etc. Versionista assumes all data _may_ contain
ePHI, even though our Risk Assessment does not indicate this is the case, and
provides appropriate protections based on that assumption.

In the case of PaaS Customers, it is the responsibility of the Customer to
restrict, secure, and assure the privacy of all ePHI data at the Application
Level, as this is not under the control or purview of Versionista.

The data and network segmentation mechanism differs depending on the primitives
offered by the underlying cloud provider infrastructure:

- Within Rackspace, hosted load balancers segment data and traffic while Cisco
  firewalls route traffic to private subnets for PaaS Customers and for Platform
  Add-ons.
- Within AWS, hosted load balancers segment data across dedicated Virtual
  Private Clouds for PaaS Customers and for Platform Add-ons.
- Within Azure, hosted load balancers segment data across dedicated Virtual
  Networks for PaaS Customers and for Platform Add-ons.
- Within SoftLayer, hosted load balancers segment data across dedicated Private
  Networks for PaaS Customers and for Platform Add-ons.

The segmentation strategies employed by Versionista effectively create RFC 1918,
or dedicated, private segmented and separated networks and IP spaces, for each
PaaS Customer and for Platform Add-ons.

Additionally, IPtables is used on each server for logical segmentation. IPtables
is configured to restrict access to only justified ports and protocols.
Versionista has implemented strict logical access controls so that only
authorized personnel are given access to the internal management servers. The
environment is configured so that data is transmitted from the load balancers to
the application servers over a TLS encrypted session.

In the case of Platform Add-ons, once the data is received from the application
server, a series of Application Programming Interface (API) calls is made to the
database servers where the ePHI resides. The ePHI is separated into PostgreSQL
and Percona databases through programming logic built so that access to one
database server will not present you with the full ePHI spectrum.

The VPN server, nginx web server, and application servers are externally facing
and accessible via the Internet. The database servers, where the ePHI resides,
are located on the internal Versionista network and can only be accessed through
a bastion host over a VPN connection. Access to the internal database is
restricted to a limited number of personnel and strictly controlled to only
those personnel with a business-justified reason. Remote access to internal
servers is not accessible except through load balancers.

All Platform Add-ons and operating systems are tested end-to-end for usability,
security, and impact prior to deployment to production.

## 1.4 Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports

Versionista, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, including its
Corrective Action Plans (CAPs), with customers on a case by case basis. All
audit reports are shared under explicit NDA in Versionista format between
Versionista and party to receive materials. Audit reports can be requested by
Versionista workforce members for Customers or directly by Versionista
Customers.

The following process is used to request audit reports:

1. Email is sent to legal@versionista.com. In the email, please specify the type
   of report being requested and any required timelines for the report.
2. Versionista staff will log an issue with the details of the request into the
   Versionista Quality Management System. The Versionista Quality Management
   System is used to track requests' status and outcomes.
3. Versionista will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the party
   requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, Versionista will
   send one for execution.
4. Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, Versionista staff will
   move the issue to "Under Review".
5. The Versionista Security Officer or Privacy Officer must Approve or Reject
   the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, Versionista will notify the requesting
   party that we cannot share the requested report.
6. If the issue has been Approved, Versionista will send the customer the
   requested audit report and complete the Quality Management System issue for
   the request.
