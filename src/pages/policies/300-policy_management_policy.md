# 3. Policy Management Policy

Versionista implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and
integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for
maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all Versionista workforce
members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all
applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease
of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## 3.1 Applicable Standards

### 3.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

- 12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information
  Security

### 3.1.2 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

- 164.316(a) - Policies and Procedures
- 164.316(b)(1)(i) - Documentation

## 3.2 Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and updated to maintain Versionista compliance with
   HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version
   control are done similarly to source code control.

2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time.
   Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and
   Privacy Officer to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.

3. Versionista employees may request changes to policies using the following
   process:

   1. The Versionista employee initiates a policy change request by creating an
      Issue in the Versionista Quality Management System. The change request may
      optionally include a GitHub pull request from a separate branch or
      repository containing the desired changes.

   2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the
      policy change request.

   3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer
      approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for
      further review and documentation.

   4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then
      marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.

   5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production
      systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using
      Versionista's
      [change management process (ยง9.4)](#9-4-changing-existing-systems).

   6. All policies are made accessible to all Versionista workforce members. The
      current master policies are published at
      [https://github.com/foxandgeese/policies](https://github.com/foxandgeese/policies).
      - Changes are automatically communicated to all Versionista team members
        through integrations between GitHub and Slack that log all GitHub policy
        channels to a dedicated Versionista Slack Channel.
      - The Security Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees
        via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy
        change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.
   7. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from
      the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever
      is later
      1. Version history of all Versionista policies is done via GitHub.
      2. Backup storage of all policies is done with Box.
   8. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited
      annually, or after significant changes occur to Versionista's
      organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process
      are reviewed by Versionista management to assure all risks and potential
      gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing
      polices is outlined below:
   9. The Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in
      the Versionista Quality Management System.
   10. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the
       current Versionista policies
       ([https://github.com/foxandgeese/policies](https://github.com/foxandgeese/policies)).
   11. If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are
       documented in the Issue.
   12. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer
       approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for
       further review and documentation.
   13. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then
       marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
   14. Policy review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality
       Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
   15. The Security Officer initiates audit activity by creating an Issue in the
       Versionista Quality Management System.
   16. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage
       the audit activity.
   17. Once the audit activity is completed, the Security Officer approves or
       rejects the Issue.
   18. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as
       Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
   19. Compliance with annual compliance assessments, utilizing the HITRUST CSF
       as a framework, is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality
       Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
