### Deployment

```
yarn
```

To build, watch for file edits and hot-reload, and run locally:

```
yarn run develop
```

To build for PROD:

```
yarn run build
```

While you could run `gatsby` commands directly, it is preferable to use
`yarn run` (and see corresponding scripts in `package.json`) so as to avoid
differences between local and global `gatsby` versions.
([See the CLI instructions for more details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli).)
